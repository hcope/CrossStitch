# CrossStitch
A piece of software which allows users to make cross stitch patterns dynamically on a webpage

This is currently a work in progress. But what I plan to eventually have is a site which allows users to drag and drop motifs (such as flowers, or hearts) and customize text so that way they can make unique cross sticth patterns that are downloadable as a PDF. There are a lot of things I don't know how to do yet (And I wouldn't say I have a lot of free time, so this is going to take a little while to make happen. Stay tuned :D
